  <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is it</font></b><br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DM CHM Decompiler 
  is a small little add-on I made in Visual Basic 6 for Windows and will allow 
  you to decompile CHM (HTML Help Files) I made <br>
  this program because I needed a way to get back my files so I found a useful 
  little command under DOS and decided to make a program that can be used in windows, 
  </font>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Setting up the decompiler</b></font><br>
<hr size="1">
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ok setting up the 
decompiler is easy first of all make sure you have the two folders that are<br>
decompiler this is the decompile<br>
install this allows you to set up the decompiler </font> 
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you don't have 
  the two folders then give me an email at dreamvb@yahoo.com I i send them but 
  they should be there.Ok lets get this thing working first load and compile the 
  decompiler program and put the exe on your desktop or were ever you like for 
  now. Next open up the install project at this moment you don't need to edit 
  any of the project code unless you need to change something. <br>
  <br>
  Right now go to the VB menu <font color="#FF0000">Tools-&gt;Add-ins-&gt;Add-in 
  Manager</font><br>
  This will now bring up the Add-in Manager dialog box find and double click on 
  &quot;<b>Visual Basic 6 Resource Editor</b>&quot; and click on now back in the 
  VB <br>
  editor and click on the button for the VB Resource editor on the toolbar this 
  will then bring up the VB Resource editor. </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now you need to 
  click <br>
  on the Add Custom resource button and you will see the dialog display now select 
  the file you compiled before the decompiler project then click <br>
  open and save the resource by clicking on the save button and return back to 
  the VB editor next go to <font color="#FF0000">File-&gt;Make install.exe</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That's it that 
  all you need to do now you can click on the install exe you made and it will 
  then install the decompiler for you to use.</font>
<hr size="1">
<b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">How to us the decompiler</font></b><br>
<hr size="1">
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Using the decompiler 
is simple locate a CHM you like to decompiler or select the example on with this 
program and right click on it you see the system menu popup and you see a item 
that stats Decompile click that the program will be shown and will ask you were 
to decompile to file to and that about it simple.<br>
<br>
</font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">O just before 
I go I have noticed a small bug while decompiling files to folders that are quit 
long such as c:\Documents and Settings\dreamvb\Desktop\VBProjects\dmCHMDecompiler\so 
if you try and extract the file to a folder like that it dose not seem to work 
so I would decompile the files say somewhere on your C drive in a folder of your 
choice as it works fine then I don't know what is causing this I tried using a 
short path function to shorten the path and other stuff but it just won't seem 
to work I think it something to do with the shell function in VB does not like 
long paths anyway I try and sort it but if any one does it before me please let 
me know.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hope you like my 
  project.<br>
  any problems please e-mail me</font><br>
